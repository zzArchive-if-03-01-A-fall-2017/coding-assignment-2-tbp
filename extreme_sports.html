      <h1 class="text-danger">Extreme sports</h1>

      <p>Extreme sports are recreational activities perceived as involving a high degree of risk.</br> These activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion, and highly specialized gear.</p>

      <h2 class="text-danger">Marketing</h2>
      <p>Some contend that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one has as much to do with marketing as with the level of danger involved or the adrenaline generated.</br> For example, rugby union is both dangerous and adrenaline-inducing but is not considered an extreme sport due to its traditional image, and because it does not involve high speed or an intention to perform stunts (the aesthetic criteria mentioned above) and also it does not have changing environmental  variables for the athletes.</br> Demolition derby racing, predominantly an adult sport, is not thought of as 'extreme' while BMX racing, a youth sport, is.</br>
         One common aspect of an extreme sport is a counter-cultural aura — a rejection of authority and of the status quo by disaffected youth.</br> Some youth of Generation Y have seized upon activities which they can claim as their own, and have begun rejecting more traditional sports in increasing numbers.</br>

      <h2 class="text-danger">Mortality</h2>
      <p>Extreme sports by their nature can be extremely dangerous, conducive to fatalities, near-fatalities and other serious injuries, and sometimes consist in treading along the brink of death.</br> This imminent and inherent danger in these sports has been considered a somewhat necessary part of its appeal, which is partially a result of pressure for athletes to make more money and provide maximum entertainment.</p>

    <article class="Health">
      <h2 class="text-danger">Health</h2>
      <p>Extreme sports is a sub-category of sports than are described as any kind of sport "of a character or kind farthest removed from the ordinary or average".</br> These kinds of sports often carry out the potential risk of serious and permanent physical injury and even death.</br> However, these sports also have the potential to produce drastic benefits on mental and physical health.</br>
        Health is an individual's state of mental and physical well-being in which they are maximising their daily potential.</br> It is divided into two main categories: mental and physical.</br>
        Mental health is a cognitive state of well-being, in this state the individual is aware of his or how own potential and is able to; cope with stresses of normal life and work productively, as well as willing to give their contribution to his or her community in a beneficial way.
        Physical health can be defined as a state of complete physical well-being in which an individual is mechanically fit to perform their daily activities and duties without any problem.</br>
        Extreme sports trigger the release of the hormone adrenaline.</br> This is a very powerful hormone as it can cause human beings to perform tremendous stunts of many sorts.</br> However, with a bad mix of other hormones it can lead people to execute terrible actions.</br> It is believed that the implementation of extreme sports on mental health patients improves their perspective and recognition of aspects of life.</p>
