      <h1>E-Sports</h1>
      <p>eSports (also known as electronic sports, esports, e-sports, competitive (video) gaming, professional (video) gaming, or pro gaming) is a form of competition using video games. Most commonly, eSports take the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players. The most common video game genres associated with eSports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter (FPS), and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). Tournaments such as The International, the League of Legends World Championship, the Evolution Championship Series and the Intel Extreme Masters provide live broadcasts of the competition, and prize money to competitors.</p>

      <h2>Games</h2>
      <p>A number of games are popular among professional competitors. The tournaments which emerged in the mid-1990s coincided with the popularity of fighting games and first-person shooters, genres which still maintain a devoted fan base. In the 2000s, real-time strategy games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean internet cafés, with crucial influence on the development of eSports worldwide. After 2010 with the release of the Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod Defense of the Ancients, multiplayer online battle arena games became popular as eSports. Competitions exist for many titles and genres, though currently the most popular games are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Dota 2, Smite, Rocket League, World of Tanks, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, Super Smash Bros. Melee, StarCraft II and Overwatch. Hearthstone has also popularized the digital collectible card game (CCG) genre since its release in 2014.</p>

      <h2>Classification as a sport</h2>
      <p>Labeling video games as sports is a controversial point of debate. While some point to the growth in popularity of eSports as justification for designating some games as sports, others contend that video games will never reach the status of "true sports". However popularity is not the only reason identified: some have argued that "careful planning, precise timing, and skillful execution"[55] ought to be what classifies an activity as sport, and that physical exertion and outdoor playing areas are not required by all traditional or non-traditional 'sports'. In a 2014 technology conference, when asked about the recent buyout of popular game streaming service Twitch, ESPN president John Skipper described eSports as "not a sport – they're a competition". In 2013 on an episode of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel the panelist openly laughed at the topic. In addition, many in the fighting games community maintain a distinction between their competitive gaming competitions and the more commercially connected eSports competitions of other genres. Video games are sometimes classified as a mind sport. In the 2015 eSports World Championship hosted by the International e-Sports Federation, an eSports panel was hosted with guests from international sports society to discuss the future recognition of eSports as a recognized, legitimate sporting activity worldwide.</p>

    <article class="Teams and associations">
      <h2>Teams and associations</h2>
      <p>Professional gamers, or "pro gamers", are often associated with gaming teams and/or broader gaming associations. Teams like OpTic Gaming, Evil Geniuses, Team SoloMid, eRa Eternity, Cloud9, Fnatic, Mineski, Counter Logic Gaming, SK Telecom T1, Splyce, Team EnVyUs, and Natus Vincere consist of several professionals. In addition to prize money from tournament wins, players may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware. Prominent eSports sponsors include companies such as Logitech and Razer. Teams feature these sponsors on their website, team jerseys[109] and on their social media, in 2016 the biggest teams have social media followings of over 1.27 million. Associations include the Korean e-Sports Association (KeSPA), the International e-Sports Federation (IeSF), the British eSports Association, the International eGames Committee (IEGC) and the World eSports Association (WESA).
      Traditional sports athletes have shown interest in eSports, examples being Rick Fox's ownership of Echo Fox and Shaquille O'Neal's investment in NRG eSports. Some soccer teams, such as Schalke 04 in Germany and PSG eSports in France, have ownership in eSports teams.</p>

      <h2>Economics</h2>
      <p>League of Legends Championship Series and League of Legends Champions Korea offer guaranteed salaries for players.[139] Despite this, online streaming is preferred by some players, as it is in some cases more profitable than competing with a team and streamers have the ability to determine their own schedule. The International tournament awards US$10 million to the winners, however teams that do not have the same amount of success often do not have financial stability and frequently break up after failing to win.[140]
      In 2015 it was estimated by SuperData Research that the global eSports industry generated revenue of around US$748.8 million that year. Asia is the leading eSports market with over $321 million in revenue, North America is around $224 million, and Europe has $172 million and the rest of the world for about $29 million.[141] Global eSports revenue is estimated to reach $1.9 billion by 2018.
      The number of female viewers has been growing in eSports, with an estimated 30% of eSports viewers being female in 2013, an increase from 15% from the previous year.[citation needed] However, despite the increase in female viewers, there is not a growth of female players in high level competitive eSports.[citation needed] The top female players that are involved in eSports mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, most notably Counter-Strike, Dead or Alive 4, and StarCraft II. All-female eSports teams include Frag Dolls and PMS Clan.</p>
